Let's Start...
Created a default ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application version 3.1

After that add a controller named Unique bowlController.cs to the controller folder
make some changes in it and then tested it using https://localhost:5001/Unique bowl
WORKING FINE...
The routing format is set in the Configure method in Startup.cs file and run it https://localhost:{PORT}/Unique bowl/Welcome
IT IS WORKING...
then chnage the welcome method in the Unique bowlController.cs and browse it using -  https://localhost:{PORT}/Unique bowl/Welcome?name=Rick&numtimes=4
However, replace the above welcome method with new code and also change the welcome method in startup.cs file
Run it- https://localhost:{PORT}/Unique bowl/Welcome/3?name=Rick

then examine the Views/_ViewStart.cshtml file and after that, go to Views/Unique bowl/Index.cshtml, change the title and <h2> tag in the code
set the title property of the ViewData dictionary
